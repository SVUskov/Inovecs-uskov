## Inovacs - test task ##

Here is my performed test task.

*Task was the next:*
1. Check the page and see what AJAX calls it actually makes to get the 
data (url, variables, methods).
2. Create your own PHP to make a call to check for existing email address via cURL.
You need to parse the response and show only messages about existing/non-existing 
emails addresses.
3. Implement the PHP to your page via AJAX.
4. Make the appropriate data validation.
5. Make sure that you have handled all errors.
6. Make sure your code is well organized and well commented so other developers 
can easily understand it.


I used a third-party library, namely it was **Validator** class for data
validation. You can find it by following the link [Validator](http://biznesguide.ru/coding/146.html)

Also I used such libraries like jQuery v2.2.4 and Bootstrap v3.3.6.
It included like dependencies and located in *vendors* folder. I used Composer for this.
 
*Require* parameters discribed in *composer.json*. So after cloning/downloading
the project need to run `composer install` in terminal.

I will be glad to hear review of written code.
